    "An Exception in Python refers to an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. It is an object that represents an exceptional condition or error that can happen during the program's execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as accessing an undefined variable, dividing a number by zero, or opening a file that doesn't exist. When an exception occurs, Python generates an exception object and halts the execution of the program, unless the exception is caught and handled by appropriate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, syntax errors are different from exceptions. Syntax errors occur when you violate the rules of Python's syntax, meaning that your code doesn't follow the proper structure and grammar of the language. These errors are typically detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing stage, before the program's execution begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors commonly occur due to missing or incorrect punctuation, misspelled keywords, or incorrect indentation. Unlike exceptions, syntax errors prevent the program from running at all because the Python interpreter cannot understand the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the key difference between exceptions and syntax errors in Python is that exceptions are runtime errors that occur during program execution, while syntax errors are detected by the interpreter before the program starts running, due to violations of the language's syntax rules."
